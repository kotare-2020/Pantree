## Branching strategy:
- master = the branch our deployments to Heroku are made from
- dev = our internal working copy for everyone to submit PRs/merge to
- feature/bug branches = our own branches to code on
- Before creating a PR, you must pull from dev and resolve any conflicts
- The person who created a branch must delete it once a feature is finished
- Dev shouldn't be merged to master without consulting the rest of the team
