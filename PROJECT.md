# Learn more about Pantree

üå± Pantree was designed to be a simple meal planner that connects users to locally sourced, sustainable ingredients.

The idea came from our team's desire to build a meal planner app that was user friendly and could not only educate users about more ethical choices when it comes to food, but also create local communities of food gatherers and growers. There are plenty of meal planner apps out there, and not many of them hit these marks.

It was built as our final group project at [Enspiral Dev Academy](https://devacademy.co.nz/). We had 7 days to build the app based on skills we had acquired over a 9 week dev bootcamp, and since completing the course, we've continued to work on Pantree as a team.

The notes below have been kept for historical purposes -- they show our initial planning and implementation documentation.

‚≠ê Pantree was built by:

## User stories

### MVP

As a user, I want:

- I want a landing page so that I can be introduced to Pantree and sign in or register
- I want to be able to sign in from the landing page so that I can start making a meal plan
- I want to be able to register from the landing page, so that I can start using Pantree
- A 'My plan' page, so that I can review my meal plan for the week. Days are numbered 1-7. Meals are listed by number, and I can add an indefinite number of meals to each day
- To add a recipe from the Pantree recipe catalogue to my plan, on the day I selected from My plan page
- A 'Recipes' page, to see what recipes are available for Pantree's catalogue for me to choose from. Each recipe should have a name, image, View and Add button
- To remove a recipe from my plan
- To view more details about a recipe from the recipe catalogue, so that I can see what ingredients are needed and how to make it. Each recipe makes 1 portion and assumes no leftovers
- To go back to the recipe catalogue if I choose not to add a recipe from View mode
- To view my shopping list, so I can see the total ingredients required for my entire weekly plan
- To see a list of local suppliers with fresh, sustainable produce
- A nav bar on all screens except the landing page, so that I can navigate between My plan, Shopping list, Recipes, Local suppliers, or Log out

### Stretch

As a user, I want:

- To be able to manually enter recipes to my own recipe catalogue, so I'm not limited by only Pantree's recipe catalogue
- To be able to add recipes by URL using screenscraping, so I can manually add recipes from the internet
- The ability to save a meal plan with a name, so that I can use it again in future if I liked it
- The option to sort my shopping list by category, so I have an easier time when I go shopping for the ingredients
- To be able to drag and drop recipes on my plan, so I can shuffle things around easily
- To be able to clone recipes on my plan, so it's easy for me to plan out multiple days with the same recipe
- To have my recipe units converted into something much easier
- The ability to save a list of items I have in my pantry already, so I can remove them from my shopping list
- Pantree to compare my total recipe list with what's already in my pantry, so I don't have ingredients already in my pantry in my final shopping list
- Pantree to suggest wine pairings with my meals and the option to add the wine to my shopping cart
- Pantree to suggest places where I can get my sustainably sourced produce
- To export my shopping list to another tool of my choice (eg. google shopping list, trello, etc.)
- The ability to click on recipes from my plan page and view selected recipe details without being able to add recipe to plan.
- The ability to click on recipes from the navbar and view recipe catalogue without being able to add recipes to plan
