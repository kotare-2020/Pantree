# Pantree

üå± Pantree is a simple meal planner app with a focus on sustainability and connecting users to locally sourced ingredients.

üî® It was built using Node, Express.js, React and Redux.

‚≠ê This was built by the following amazing people, as part of our final group project at [Enspiral Dev Academy](https://devacademy.co.nz/):

- [Aisyah Tajudin](https://github.com/aisyah-t)
- [Ben Means](https://github.com/benjamin-means)
- [Fai Songprasit](https://github.com/fai-songprasit)
- [Jefferson Matumba](https://github.com/JeffersonMat)
- [Joe Butler](https://github.com/joe-butler-dev)
- [Rose Mead](https://github.com/rose-mead)
