# User stories

## MVP

As a user, I want:

- A landing page, so that I can be introduced to Pantree
- To be able to sign in from the landing page, so that I can look at my meal plan
- To be able to register from the landing page, so that I can start using Pantree
- A 'My plan' page, so that I can review my meal plan for the week. Days are numbered 1-7. Meals are listed by number, and I can add an indefinite number of meals to each day
- To add a recipe from the Pantree recipe catalogue to my plan, on the day I selected from My plan page
- A 'Recipes' page, to see what recipes are available for Pantree's catalogue for me to choose from. Each recipe should have a name, image, View and Add button
- To remove a recipe from my plan
- To view more details about a recipe from the recipe catalogue, so that I can see what ingredients are needed and how to make it. Each recipe makes 1 portion and assumes no leftovers
- To go back to the recipe catalogue if I choose not to add a recipe from View mode
- To view my shopping list, so I can see the total ingredients required for my entire weekly plan
- To see a list of local suppliers with fresh, sustainable produce
- A nav bar on all screens except the landing page, so that I can navigate between My plan, Shopping list, Local suppliers, or Log out

## Stretch

As a user, I want:

- To be able to manually enter recipes to my own recipe catalogue, so I'm not limited by only Pantree's recipe catalogue
- To be able to add recipes by URL using screenscraping, so I can manually add recipes from the internet
- The ability to save a meal plan with a name, so that I can use it again in future if I liked it
- The option to sort my shopping list by category, so I have an easier time when I go shopping for the ingredients
- To be able to drag and drop recipes on my plan, so I can shuffle things around easily
- To be able to clone recipes on my plan, so it's easy for me to plan out multiple days with the same recipe
- To have my recipe units converted into something much easier
- The ability to save a list of items I have in my pantry already, so I can remove them from my shopping list
- Pantree to compare my total recipe list with what's already in my pantry, so I don't have ingredients already in my pantry in my final shopping list
- Pantree to suggest wine pairings with my meals and the option to add the wine to my shopping cart
- Pantree to suggest places where I can get my sustainably sourced produce
- To export my shopping list to another tool of my choice (eg. google shopping list, trello, etc.)
