          </h4>
          <h5>About:</h5>
          <p>
            The seed for Commonsense was sown in 1975. Jim Kebbell and Marion
            Wood (and a bunch of other hippie dreamers) bought some land in Te
            Horo and named it Common Property. The idea was to grow vegetables
            as a way to connect young and marginalised people with the land.
